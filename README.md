# Penny-Stock-Analysis-on-Market-Sentiment
A model has been created which takes market sentiment into account and a few experiments on it has been done by testing the model on a few penny stocks.
A time series data has been used for both stock and market sentiment.

A Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) architecture which uses Multi-Variate Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) model has been created to predict the trend of the penny stock. Market Sentiment has been taken into consideration. Twitter data has been scraped, cleansed and market sentiment has been calculated based on it.

<b>With Market Sentiment vs Without Market Sentiment</b> comparision and analysis has been made on a few penny stocks (SALSTEEL, SOUTHBANK, TFL QUINN).

The above mentioned experiments or tests on penny stocks has shown that considering the Market Sentiment into the model would give a better result.
