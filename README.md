# Penny-Stock-Analysis-on-Market-Sentiment
A model has been created which takes market sentiment into account and a few experiments on it has been done by testing the model on a few penny stocks.


A Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) architecture which uses Long Short-term Memory(LSTM) model has been used to predict the trend of a penny stock. Market Sentiment has been taken into consideration. Twitter data has been scraped, cleansed and market sentiment has been calculated based on it.

<b>With Market Sentiment vs Without Market Sentiment</b> comparision and analysis have been made on a few penny stocks (SALSTEEL, SOUTHBANK, TFL QUINN).

The above mentioned experiments or tests on a few penny stocks have showed that considering the Market Sentiment would give a better result.
